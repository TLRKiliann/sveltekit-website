		"If koalas become too numerous in a restricted area, they defoliate preferred\n"+ 
		"food trees and, unable to subsist on even closely related species, decline \n"+
		"rapidly. To aid in digesting as much as 1.3 kg (3 pounds) of leaves daily, \n"+
		"the koala has an intestinal pouch (cecum) about 2 metres (7 feet) long, where \n"+
		"symbiotic bacteria degrade the tannins and other toxic and complex substances \n"+
		"abundant in eucalyptus. This diet is relatively poor in nutrients and provides \n"+
		"the koala little spare energy, so the animal spends long hours simply sitting or \n"+
		"sleeping in tree forks, exposed to the elements but insulated by thick fur. \n"+
		"Although placid most of the time, koalas produce loud, hollow grunts."

		"the WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft \n"+
		"Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the \n"+
		"Bitcoin cryptocurrency.[5] It propagated by using EternalBlue, an exploit developed by \n"+
		"the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for Windows systems. EternalBlue was \n"+ 
		"stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers a month prior to the attack. \n"+
		"While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's \n"+
		"spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows \n"+ 
		"systems that were past their end-of-life. These patches were imperative to organizations' \n"+ 
		"cyber security but many were not implemented due to ignorance of their importance. Some \n"+
		"have claimed a need for 24/7 operation, aversion to risking having formerly working \n"+
		"applications breaking because of patch changes, lack of personnel or time to install them, \n"+
		"or other reasons.\n"+
		"The attack began at 07:44 UTC on 12 May 2017 and was halted a few hours later at 15:03 \n"+
		"UTC by the registration of a kill switch discovered by Marcus Hutchins. The kill switch \n"+
		"prevented already infected computers from being encrypted or further spreading WannaCry.[6]\n"+ 
		"The attack was estimated to have affected more than 300,000 computers[7] across 150 \n"+
		"countries,[7] with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. \n"+
		"At the time, security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the \n"+
		"attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country. This was confirmed \n"+
		"in December 2017, when the United States and United Kingdom formally asserted that North \n"+
		"Korea was behind the attack.[8]\n"+
		"A new variant of WannaCry forced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to \n"+
		"temporarily shut down several of its chip-fabrication factories in August 2018. The virus \n"+
		"spread onto 10,000 machines in TSMC's most advanced facilities.[9]"
